## 5 Business Challenges Solved

### 1. Asymmetric Information & Trust Deficit (Mutual Reviews)
*   **The Challenge:** Customers hesitate to invite unknown technicians into their homes, and technicians suffer from lack of platforms to showcase their trustworthiness.
*   **The Solution:** Implemented a verified review system where customer reviews are bound to successful bookings. The dashboard review mechanism ([getAllReviews.ts](file:///e:/Programming%20Hero/Next%20Level/FixItNow/src/app/(dashboard)/_actions/getAllReviews.ts) & [LeaveReview.ts](file:///e:/Programming%20Hero/Next%20Level/FixItNow/src/app/(dashboard)/_actions/LeaveReview.ts)) ensures reviews cannot be faked or duplicated, fostering trust.

### 2. Booking Conflicts & Billable Hour Leaks (Availability Slots)
*   **The Challenge:** Traditional scheduling relies on verbal agreements, leading to double bookings and lost hours for technicians.
*   **The Solution:** Built a real-time availability slot generator ([createAvailability.ts](file:///e:/Programming%20Hero/Next%20Level/FixItNow/src/app/(dashboard)/_actions/createAvailability.ts)). Technicians set exact, non-overlapping work windows that customers book instantly ([serviceBooking.ts](file:///e:/Programming%20Hero/Next%20Level/FixItNow/src/app/(public)/services/_actions/serviceBooking.ts)), preventing schedule overlaps.

### 3. Payment Insecurity & Unreliable Offline Cash (Stripe/SSLCommerz)
*   **The Challenge:** Offline payments often lead to unpaid invoices, awkward transaction dialogues, or payment disputes.
*   **The Solution:** Standardized secure transactions via multi-provider checkouts ([checkoutPayment.ts](file:///e:/Programming%20Hero/Next%20Level/FixItNow/src/app/(dashboard)/_actions/checkoutPayment.ts) & [createPayment.ts](file:///e:/Programming%20Hero/Next%20Level/FixItNow/src/app/(dashboard)/_actions/createPayment.ts)). It handles global payments (Stripe) and local gateways (SSLCommerz) to capture payment states securely.

### 4. Spam, Fraud & Abuse Mitigation (Moderator Controls)
*   **The Challenge:** Marketplace open access invites malicious behavior, bad actors, or unauthorized listings.
*   **The Solution:** Empowered administrators with status moderation ([updateUserStatusByAdmin.ts](file:///e:/Programming%20Hero/Next%20Level/FixItNow/src/app/(dashboard)/_actions/updateUserStatusByAdmin.ts) & [getAllUsers.ts](file:///e:/Programming%20Hero/Next%20Level/FixItNow/src/app/(dashboard)/_actions/getAllUsers.ts)). Admins can ban, block, or approve users instantly, enforcing quality standards and protecting legitimate users.

### 5. Session Vulnerability & Slow Client State Shifts (Secure Middleware Proxy)
*   **The Challenge:** Storing raw JWT tokens in browser LocalStorage exposes applications to XSS attacks, while constant network roundtrips slow down user experience.
*   **The Solution:** Configured HttpOnly Cookie storage coupled with a Next.js middleware proxy ([proxy.ts](file:///e:/Programming%20Hero/Next%20Level/FixItNow/src/proxy.ts)). The proxy refreshes expired tokens in the background ([refreshToken.ts](file:///e:/Programming%20Hero/Next%20Level/FixItNow/src/services/refreshToken.ts)) without interrupting user navigation, guarding dashboards.
